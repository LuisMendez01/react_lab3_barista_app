In this app inspired by Wordle, memorize coffee drink recipes and quiz yourself on a random real (and possibly discontinued 😉) Starbucks drink's temperature, flavor, milk type, and blendedness. The app will let you know if you're a natural at barista-ing.

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] One drink at a time is displayed
- [x] The user can click one option for each of the four categories to input their answer
- [x] The selected option populates into the box above, and if an option is already in the box, it is replaced by the new option
- [x] Clicking “check answer” submits the answer to be checked for correctness
- [x] After clicking “check answer”, the user can see which components of a drink they entered correctly and incorrectly by having the box for that answer change visually
- [x] Clicking on the new drink button shows a new drink and clears the input boxes
